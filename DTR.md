## Setting Group Expectations for Rush Hour

Group Member Names: Zack Forbing, Garrett Smestad, Pat Wentz

1. When are group members available to work together? What hours can each group member work individually? Are there any personal time commitments that need to be discussed?

  It seems like we will all be able to work as late as necessary and as early as necessary. the only conflict was tonight Garrett had to leave so we are all brushing up on ActiveRecord.

1. How will group members communicate? How often will communication happen, and how will open lines of communication be maintained?

  We have started a three-way Slack chat and made sure our Do Not Disturb settings are set up correctly so that if we are awake, we still get notifications

1. Which feature(s) does each group member *want* to work on? Which feature(s) does each group member *not want* to work on?

  for myself, I want to be able to understand everything. there isn't really anything I don't want to work on. I have a bit of javascript experience that might help us write that particular extension if we decide to go that route.

1. What does each group member hope to get out of the project?

  I want to come out of this project with a strong understanding of ActiveRecord databases. getting a bit stronger in CSS won't be a bad idea either. I want to learn better planning and various soft skills related to working in teams. I want to be more communicative when we are not working together. I want to be less afraid to take control.

  Pat hopes to gain some interpersonal skills relating to working and communicating together.

  Garrett wants to learn more on sql dbs, and to be able to think while doing, and to be able to speak up more often when he doesn't understand.

1. What is the agreed upon Git workflow? What project management tool will be used? What is the agreed upon procedure for conducting code reviews before merging into master: who will review pull requests, and when?

  we will each work on our own branches per iteration, and check each other's commits with comments etc. we might use waffle. I think it would be a good idea, but it might have been nice to have an understanding of waffle before today. on splitting up, we each push to our branches, and more so, just push often. also setting up waffle for when we divide and conquer.

1. What is expected of group members when they run into problems implementing a feature?

  communication with the rest of the group is necessary. if they run into problems, their branch can be downloaded so the others can see if they can help.
  Group: slack, check ins every two days at least. end of week planning for going through the weekend

1. How does each group member want feedback (both positive and constructive) to be delivered?

  slack is best for me. I'm terrible with remembering to write things down, so having it written in the first place is great.

1. Is there anything else the group should know about personal work/communication styles?
